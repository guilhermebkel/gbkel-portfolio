				It was the first time I have been in touch with programming.
				<br />
				<br />
				In this course I have learned the basics about <u>C Language</u> and got mad multiple times
				since I was creating a lot of bugs because of bad code writing. üòÇ
				<br />
				<br />
				In the end I have made a <u>2048 Game</u> with lot of bugs, but feeling awesome for creating something. ü§©

				That is a non-governmental organization that helps the education cause and was my first time creating something with programming to someone. üë®‚Äçüéì
